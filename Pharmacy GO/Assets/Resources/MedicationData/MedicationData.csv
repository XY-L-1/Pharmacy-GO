Timolol,1,Eyes,"Nonselective β‑blocker","Blocks both β₁ and β₂ receptors; reducing heart rate/contractility and decreasing aqueous humor production in the eye.","Primary: Glaucoma (topical eye drops); Secondary: Hypertension; migraine prophylaxis","Bradycardia; hypotension; Bronchospasm (β₂ blockade); Masked hypoglycemia (diabetics)","Caution in asthma/COPD; Caution in diabetes (masks hypoglycemia)","“Timolol helps ‘tame’ high eye pressure”"
Albuterol (Salbutamol),1,Lungs,"Short‑acting β₂‑adrenergic agonist (SABA)","Activates β₂ receptors → bronchodilation","Primary: Acute asthma relief; prophylaxis for exercise‑induced bronchospasm; Secondary: COPD rescue inhaler","Tachycardia; palpitations; Tremor; Nervousness; Hypokalemia (high doses)","Caution with MAO inhibitors; Additive tachycardia with other stimulants","Known as “Salbutamol” in many countries—“SABA to the rescue!”"
Brimonidine,1,Eyes,"α₂‑adrenergic agonist","Reduces aqueous humor production; increases uveoscleral outflow; local vasoconstriction","Primary: Open‑angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension; Secondary: Topical gel for rosacea (reduces facial erythema)","Eye irritation; dryness; Fatigue; mild hypotension; Possible sedation","Caution in cardiovascular disease; Avoid MAO inhibitors (risk of crisis)","“Bri‑moni‑dine” helps “bring down” the pressure in the eye—and the redness on the cheeks."
Metoprolol,1,Heart,"Selective β₁‑blocker (cardioselective)","Blocks β₁ receptors; decreases HR and contractility","Hypertension; angina; heart failure; Post‑MI management; certain arrhythmias","Bradycardia; hypotension; Fatigue; dizziness; Masks hypoglycemia (diabetics)","Avoid abrupt withdrawal (rebound tachycardia); Caution in severe asthma","A mnemonic: “Metoprolol meets the heart first” (β₁ > β₂)."
Tetrahydrozoline,1,Eyes,"α‑adrenergic agonist (primarily α₁)","Causes vasoconstriction of local blood vessels in mucous membranes","Primary: Ocular decongestant (“gets the red out”); Secondary: Nasal decongestant in some formulations","Rebound congestion (chronic use); Local irritation; dryness; Possible hypertension (overdose)","Avoid in narrow‑angle glaucoma (↑ IOP); Caution in uncontrolled hypertension","“TetrahydrozoLINE lines the blood vessels to keep them constricted,” reducing redness."
